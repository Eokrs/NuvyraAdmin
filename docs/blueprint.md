## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#6246EA) to evoke sophistication and control.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-purple (#211B3D) for a modern dark theme, almost black, creates a glassmorphism effect.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#3498DB) to draw the user's attention to important calls to action. This contrasts well with purple hues and the background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, will provide a clean, modern look suitable for an administrative interface.
- Use a consistent set of minimalistic icons throughout the admin interface for quick visual recognition. Aim for simple, geometric shapes with a thin stroke width.
- Employ a responsive, grid-based layout to ensure usability across devices. The admin panel should be well-organized with clear hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth transitions and animations (e.g., on hover or form submission) to enhance the user experience. Avoid excessive animations that could distract or slow down the interface.
